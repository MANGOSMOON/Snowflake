# ❄️ Snowflakes 

This project is a simple HTML webpage that explores snowflakes and the fascinating science behind their formation. It combines visual elements with scientific explanations to help users understand how snowflakes form, why they are unique, and what determines their shapes.

## 📌 Project Overview

The webpage provides:

- An introduction to snowflakes
- The science of crystal formation
- How temperature and humidity affect snowflake shapes
- The reason behind their six-sided symmetry
- Interesting facts about snowflakes

The goal of this project is to present scientific information in a visually appealing and easy-to-understand format using only HTML (and optional basic CSS).

## 🔬 Scientific Background

Snowflakes are ice crystals that form in clouds when water vapor freezes. Their structure is influenced by environmental conditions such as:

- **Temperature**
- **Humidity**
- **Air currents**

Each snowflake develops a hexagonal (six-sided) structure due to the molecular arrangement of water molecules when they freeze.

As a result, no two snowflakes are exactly alike — though they all share the same basic symmetry.
