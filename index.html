<h2><i> How are snowflakes formed? </i></h2>

<p><i> Snowflakes form when water vapor travels through the air and condenses on a particle. This begins to form a slowly growing ice crystal--a snowflake! There are two basic ways that the vapor can condense, and each way plays a big role in the shape that the snowflake will eventually take.</i></p>

   <p>The more detailed explanation is this: 
The ice crystals that make up snowflakes are symmetrical (or patterned) because they reflect the internal order of the crystal’s water molecules as they arrange themselves in predetermined spaces (known as “crystallization”) to form a six-sided snowflake. 
Ultimately, it is the temperature at which a crystal forms — and to a lesser extent the humidity of the air — that determines the basic shape of the ice crystal. Thus, we see long needle-like crystals at 23 degrees F and very flat plate-like crystals at 5 degrees F.  
The intricate shape of a single arm of the snowflake is determined by the atmospheric conditions experienced by entire ice crystal as it falls. A crystal might begin to grow arms in one manner, and then minutes or even seconds later, slight changes in the surrounding temperature or humidity causes the crystal to grow in another way. Although the six-sided shape is always maintained, the ice crystal (and its six arms) may branch off in new directions. Because each arm experiences the same atmospheric conditions, the arms look identical.  </p>
<ul>
  <li>When people talk about snowflakes being “perfectly symmetrical,” what do they mean? </li>
  <li>Why do snowflakes have six sides? </li>
  <li>Snow forms in chaotic, fast-changing clouds—so why do snowflakes end up looking so orderly? </li>
</ul>
